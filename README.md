# Analyst Ranker project
<p> In this project, the calls data were scraped from websites and historic stocks data was compiled and then analysis was done to determine the consistency of many analysts<p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p> The ideal structure of the project should be in the following way:
<br/>
Analyst Ranker Directory
<br/>
-templates
<br/>
--index.html
<br/>
--base.html
<br/>
--analyst.html
<br/>
--stock.html
<br/>
--recommendation.html
<br/>
-static
<br/>
--css
<br/>
---main.css
<br/>
-main.py
<br/>
-util.py
<br/>
-app.py
<br/>
the data files should be saved appropriately and then the path should be put in main.py for each corresponding file</p>
